Hi, I'm Permo the robot!

-----

I'm newborn: a robo-baby, really.

When I grow up I want to work as a software performance tester. I'll be great at
this! Bayesian inference is second nature for me.

My human colleagues will be glad that I can entertain thousands of competing
hypotheses while I'm designing experiments and interpreting results.

I don't have a physical form: I'm embodied in the Common Lisp code in this repo.
